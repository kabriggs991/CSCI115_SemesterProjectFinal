# CSCI115_SemesterProjectFinal

This is the final part of the Semester project. The first two parts had you creating a photography website where you applied positioning of elements, demonstrating basic HTML and CSS syntax and best practices, and the second had you implementing a responsive grid-based layout. 

## Assignment
In this part, you will be applying the finishing touches to your portfolio. 
  1. Make any improvements to your Photography and Restaurant website that you wanted to but did not get a chance to before the due date. Since I am not requiring another website, I expect these to have improvements.
  2. Make sure you have a proper directory structure. (I do not want a bunch of files just submitted). The directory structure in this respository is a good example.
  3. **GitHub users:** Submit links to both your repositories. **Non-GitHub users:** Submit a .zip file that has a file structure similar to this repository. I am looking for a top level directory called 'Portfolio'. Inside that directory should be two directories named after part 1 and part 2 websites (ie. PhotographyWebsite and RestaurantWebsite). Inside of each of those should be the corresponding project files. Make sure to include all images and/or pictures. These should have **relative** file paths inside your HTML and CSS files so that they can be viewed from any computer. Submissions should be made in OAKS.
  4. Submit a **write-up** of your experiences with this project and course. At a project level: summarize what features you were successful in completing and which ones you intended to have but ran out of time. At a course level: include your positive as well as negative ones. This is the first class I've ever taught and had no point of reference when creating the course. It was not required for me to take as an undergrad or grad so I did not have any kind of experience as to what was too difficult, too easy, heavy workload, etc. Also include what you would have liked to have done that we did not get to do as. Be sure to address your opinion on classroom tools, such as OAKS, Piazza, Google Hangouts, GitHub, etc. I also want you to discuss your design approach to both websites and what issues you encountered. Include how you solved each issue. (This is waived from the write-up for any student that demo's the project to me during the final exam period).
  
## EXTRA CREDIT:
  1. Deploy your website. There are different ways in which you can deploy your website so that it is accessible to the outside world. You are free to use any that you care to. Provide me the website URL for extra credit. A couple of options are:
    * Any student may put their web site on a [CofC web server](http://it.cofc.edu/vvw/web/stu.php) dedicated for students.
    * Follow the guideline in the [HostingInstructions](HostingInstructions.md) file in this repository.
    * Deploying static site with ftp [guide](FtpInstructions.md)
  2.  Make improvements to this project and submit as a Pull request. Any improvements will get you extra points. Some improvements are worth more points than others, for example misspelled word fixes will not be as many as another set of instructions on how to deploy a website. To do this, you must have a GitHub account. Simply Fork the project. This will make a copy as a repository into your GitHub account and you can edit the files. This can be done from within the web browser. Commit your changes and click on 'New Pull Request' and then 'Create Pull Request'. 
  3. Create a web site that will showcase you as a web developer/designer. This is an [example](http://www.william-byrd.com/index.html) site.  

### The purpose of the Semester Project:
  1. Showcase some of the major web design topics presented this semester.
  2. Allow me to see some of your creative style.
  3. Reinforce your knowledge of a well-formed HTML.
  4. Demostrate your knowledge building a basic structure for a website.
  5. Demonstrate your knowledge of CSS.
  6. Provide you with a start of a portfolio that you can continue to improve and add on to..
